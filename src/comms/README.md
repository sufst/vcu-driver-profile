# Comms/Flatbufs

Flatbuffers enable easier (de)serialisation for the comms protocol. It needs to be serialised before it goes onto the CAN bus.

Flatbuffs docs can be found [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/index.html) and Flatcc is used to create the C code, the GitHub for that is [here](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc).

We are the VCU-Comms team so if you have any questions message us on Discord (Toby Godfrey and George Peppard) or find us at one of the meetings (we'll probably be playing with a CANdapter).
